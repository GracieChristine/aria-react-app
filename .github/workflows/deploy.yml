### 4. GitHub Secrets you'll need to add

Once your repo is on GitHub, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add these:
```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN       # from netlify.com → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
NETLIFY_SITE_ID          # from your Netlify site → Site Settings → General
VITE_API_BASE_URL        # your Render server URL e.g. https://aria-api.onrender.com/api
RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL   # from Render → your service → Settings → Deploy Hook
